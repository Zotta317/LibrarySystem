# üìö Library System

A simple .NET-based backend application for managing a library's book collection, including features for tracking available books, removed books, and restoring previously deleted entries.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Get, Add, update, and delete books that represent basic functionalities for CRUD operations on book records
- Search, filter and pagination for books based on specific filters
- View and restore removed books in case they are lost or worn out (RemovedBook)
- Maintain user profiles (Profiles)
- Book Lending Managment Process: The system facilitates book lending through a borrowing process (BookRecord POST) and a return process (BookRecord PUT /{id}). When a user borrows a book, the system creates a record of the transaction. Upon returning the book, the record is updated rather than deleted.
- Built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework
